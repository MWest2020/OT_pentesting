# Conpot

Conpot is what we will use to simulate PLC controllers. Although real hosts and PLC's can be found, pentesting these realt-time hosts really is a grey legal area and should not be done without permission of the owner. Hence Conpots.

Install conpot with:

`sudo pp install conpot`

## Post-Installation

### Running Conpot: To start Conpot, simply run conpot in the terminal

`conpot -f --template default`

### Configuration

Conpot comes with a default configuration, but you can customize it to suit your needs.

Documentation: For more detailed configuration options and usage instructions, refer to the official Conpot documentation.
