# SNMP-Check

`snmp-check` is a tool designed to extract information from network devices (such as routers, switches,
printers, etc.) that are configured to use the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). SNMP is a protocol 
used for monitoring and managing network-connected devices.

## Using SNMP

`smnp-check --port [IP address]`

> **NOTE:** check if port 161 (00) is open for UDP for more information about target devices

This will often output information like Vendor, Model, Series, Type, CPU-type, and information about the network.
